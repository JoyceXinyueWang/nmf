\emph{This project numerically compares the robustness of two nonnegative matrix factorization (\textsc{nmf}) algorithm \citep{lee2001algorithms} based on multiplicative update rules when contaminated by large magnitude Gaussian, Poisson and Salt \& Pepper noise. Section~\ref{chp3} briefly review relevant work in the field of \textsc{nmf}, which found these multiplicative update rules are very sensitive to initialisation. Section~\ref{chapter2} describes the two algorithm and their theoretical properties, proposes a solution to make the multiplicative update rules less sensitive to initialisation, and details the statistical tools we used to compare the robustness of the two algorithm. Our simulation results in Section~\ref{chapter4} agree with the theoretical properties of the two algorithm. Future work involves embed the proposed multiple initialisation into the \textsc{nvdia} \textsc{gpu} based parallel-programming model.}
